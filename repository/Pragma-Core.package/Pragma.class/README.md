I represent an occurrence of a pragma in a compiled method.  A pragma is a literal message pattern that occurs between angle brackets at the start of a method after any temporaries.  A common example is the primitive pragma:
	<primitive: 123 errorCode: 'errorCode'>
but one can add one's own and use them as metadata attached to a method.  Because pragmas are messages one can browse senders and implementors and perform them.  One can query a method for its pragmas by sendng it the pragmas message, which answers an Array of instances of me, one for each pragma in the method.

I can provide information about the defining class, method, its selector, as well as the information about the pragma keyword and its arguments. See the two 'accessing' protocols for details. 'accessing-method' provides information about the method the pragma is found in, while 'accessing-pragma' is about the pragma itself.

Instances are retrieved using one of the pragma search methods of the 'finding' protocol on the class side.
