## WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently there are scripts scattered across the [google glassdb wiki][8], but there is no single place for folks 
to go to see what the current state of the directory should be. The directory contents get refreshed with GemStone 
releases, but the GemStone product release cycle doesn't match the development cycle for the scripts and gemstone 
support.

Of course, with a project on github, we can all easily contribute to the project, fork our own copy of the project 
to make our own custom modifications while still being able to merge in changes that come with updates and 
improvements in the scripts ...

I know for a fact that there is a gap between the code distributed for GLASS and the scripts that are dependent 
upon that code, with this project I expect that this gap can be CLOSED.

The current version that is up on github is a blind copy of my working seaside directory for 2.4.4.1, so you're 
not looking at a finished product ... 

Right now I'd like to start collaborative work on:

1. defining the structure of the seaside (glass?) directory.
2. get the correct versions of the current crop of scripts in the right spots
3. integrate support scripts that other folks find useful and are willing to share

I am certain that folks have done things that are worth sharing. I know that there are other 
gemstone-related projects on github and I will start to fork those projects on the glassdb 
organization page so that we will have visibility of them ... 

If you are interested in helping with the process then I will add you as an owner or 
collaborator depending upon which level of access/control you'd like. If you simply want to fork 
the project and issue occasional pull requests, then that is fine as well ...
